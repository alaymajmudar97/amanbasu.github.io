### Biography
I am an undergraduate, final year student pursuing Computer Engineering from Nirma University, Ahmedabad, India. I have been
working in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from past 2 years and have worked on projects involving Computer Vision, Agriculture, Neuclear Physics, Parallel Computing, Medical Imaging and Audio Signal Processing. Besides the academic activities, I am very passionte about Body Building and Fitness.

### Research

#### Predicting the dynamics of Tokamak discharge
##### Department 
- We were able to anticipate the disruption of plasma current 12ms prior to the actual disruption (4ms earlier than the state-of-the-art models).
- The model was developed in Tensorflow using LSTM, and was successfully tested, giving real time inferencing with an accuracy of 95%.
- Features were given as reading of probes like plasma current, mirnov, loop voltage etc.

#### Plant disease Identification
- Classification of plant/crop species and diseases using images.
- Predicting severity of the disease using the above information along with other parameters like soil, weather, region etc.
- Recommending preventive measures for the disease.

#### Tumor Segmentation
- Detection of tumorous regions in MRI body scans, using 3D fully-convolutional neural networks.

### Projects

#### Hospital Management System
- A software developed on JavaFx to store hospital details like patient information, staff information, department details etc. in SQL database.

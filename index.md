# Research

####  Multi-Sensor Data Classification <br> (Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), India)  
- Developed a complex machine learning architecture for joint use of hyperspectral images and
lidar data which improved the classification accuracy  by 15\%.
- Investigated the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Maximum Likelihood With Leave-One-Out-Covariance Algorithm Classifiers for the analysis of complex forest
species.
- Analyzed the effect of different lidar returns on classification accuracy.

#### Identifying Potential Customers Through Object Detection And Twitter
- Using concepts from image processing and deep learning techniques, We propose a novel approach to deal with the  problem of target market identification in social media. 
- Effectively retrieved, preprocessed the tweets using Tweepy API and analyzed the dataset from MongoDB using aggregation pipeline.
- Applied Mask-RCNN algorithm for object detection.



#### Clustering of Satellite Images for Data Analysis <br> Space Application Centre, ISRO (India)
-  Conducted an experiment to analyse the results of  DBSCAN, OPTICS, K-means, PAM and CLARANS on Data available from OCM2/MODIS Sensor for Gujarat Region for the year 2010.

-   Hadoop, Map-Reduce, Spark programming paradigms were
studied and implemented on 1 Master and 2 Slave Architecture. 

- The results reveal that CLARANS gives better clusters as compared to DBSCAN which
eliminate the small clusters considering them as outliers. 


#### Analysis of crop health
- Detection of crop species and diseases using image data.
- Predicting severity of the disease using the above information along with other parameters like soil, weather, region etc.

#### Speech Emotion Recognition [link](https://github.com/amanbasu/speech-emotion-recognition)
- Prediction of human emotions from raw audio using IEMOCAP database.
- Bidirectional LSTM was used along with local attention mechanism to focus on the part of speech which influence the emotion more.
- The architecture was trained on NVIDIA K80 system and gave results comparable to the state-of-the-art models.

#### Autonomous Car [link](https://github.com/amanbasu/Autonomous-Car-Prototype)
- A self-driving RC car which maneuvered itself on an indoor, hand-made track.
- Convolutional Neural Network was used to classify the direction of car from dashcam images.
- The model was able to achieve a classifying accuracy of 94%.

# Other Projects

#### VM Car Rentals [link](https://github.com/amanbasu/Breaking-Bill)
- Managed backend routes using Express.JS and REST API. 
- Designed and managed a scalable database using MongoDB and programmed queries for several use-cases. 
- Developed on AWS Cloud9 IDE and deployed on Goorm Ide  server in order to design a scalable website.

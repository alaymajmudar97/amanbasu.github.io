# Biography
I am an undergraduate, final year student pursuing Computer Engineering from Nirma University, Ahmedabad, India. I have been
working in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from past 2 years and have worked on projects involving Computer Vision, Agriculture, Neuclear Physics, Parallel Computing, Medical Imaging and Audio Signal Processing. Besides the academic activities, I am very passionte about Body Building and Fitness.

# Research

#### Predicting the dynamics of Tokamak discharge (Department of Atomic Energy, India)  
- The aim of the research was to anticipate the phenomenon of **Disruption** during Plasma confinement in Aditya Tokamak.
- We were able to anticipate the disruption of plasma current **12ms** prior to the actual disruption (4ms earlier than the state-of-the-art models).
- The model was developed in Tensorflow using LSTM, and was successfully tested, giving real time inferencing with an accuracy of **95%**.
- Features were given as reading of probes like plasma current, mirnov, loop voltage etc.

#### Plant disease Identification
- Classification of plant/crop species and diseases using image data.
- Predicting severity of the disease using the above information along with other parameters like soil, weather, region etc.
- Recommending preventive measures for the disease.

#### Tumor Segmentation
- Detection of tumorous regions in MRI body scans, using **3D fully-convolutional neural networks**.

#### Speech Emotion Recognition
- Prediction of human emotions from raw audio using **IEMOCAP database**.
- Bidirectional LSTM was used along with local attention mechanism to focus on the part of speech which influence the emotion more.
- The architecture was trained on NVIDIA K80 system and gave results comparable to the state-of-the-art models.

#### Autonomous Car
- A self-driving RC car which maneuvered itself on an indoor, hand-made track.
- Convolutional Neural Network was used to classify the direction of car from dashcam images.
- The model was able to achieve a classifying accuracy of **94%**.


# Other Projects

#### Breaking Bill
- Android application to add expenses to a list along with the members who share it.
- Users can generate bills and split monthly expenses among members according to their contributions.

#### File Sender Application
- An android application to send files from one android device to another.
- The application used wifi direct and socket programming.
- It was capable to sharing any type of file format like image, audio, video, text, pdf, doc, xls etc.

#### Hospital Management System
- A software developed on JavaFx to store hospital details like patient information, staff information, department details etc. in SQL database.
